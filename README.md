# Unexpected Null Handling in JavaScript Addition Function

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in JavaScript related to handling null values in a simple addition function. The `foo` function is designed to add two numbers but returns `null` if either input is `null`.  This behavior, while technically correct, can lead to unexpected results or errors if not carefully considered in the application logic.

## Bug Description

The core issue lies in the function's direct return of `null` upon encountering a `null` argument.  This might not align with the expected behavior in all use cases, potentially leading to silent failures or unexpected application state changes.

## Solution

The solution involves providing a more robust handling of `null` values. This can be achieved by either treating `null` as 0, throwing an error, or using a more sophisticated validation approach based on the specific application requirements. The `bugSolution.js` file illustrates one potential approach.
